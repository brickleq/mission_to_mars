Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

* Start by converting your Jupyter notebook into a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` with a function called `scrape` that will execute all of your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.

* Next, create a route called `/scrape` that will import your `scrape_mars.py` script and call your `scrape` function.

  * Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

* Create a root route `/` that will query your Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.

* Create a template HTML file called `index.html` that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements. Use the following as a guide for what the final product should look like, but feel free to create your own design.

    ### Mars Facts
    # Visit the Mars Facts webpage [here](https://space-facts.com/mars/) and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.
    url = 'https://space-facts.com/mars/'

    html_table_string = pd.read_html(str(html_string))

    ### Mars Hemispheres
    # Visit the USGS Astrogeology site [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.
    url = 'https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars'

    i = 0
    for hemisphere in hemispheres:
        # You will need to click each of the links to the hemispheres in order to find the image url to the full resolution image.
        browser.find_link_by_partial_text(' Hemisphere')[i].click(); time.sleep(2)
        browser.find_link_by_text("Original").click();time.sleep(2)

#%%
#* Next, create a route called `/scrape` that will import your `scrape_mars.py` script and call your `scrape` function.

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/scrape")
def run_scraper():
    print("Server received request for '/scrape' page...")
    return "Welcome to my 'Home' page!"


# 4. Define what to do when a user hits the /about route
@app.route("/about")
def about():
    print("Server received request for 'About' page...")
    return "Welcome to my 'About' page!"


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

## Step 3 - Submission

To submit your work to BootCampSpot, create a new GitHub repository and upload the following:

1. The Jupyter Notebook containing the scraping code used.

2. Screenshots of your final application.

3. Submit the link to your new repository to BootCampSpot.

## Hints

* Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.

* Use Pymongo for CRUD applications for your database. For this homework, you can simply overwrite the existing document each time the `/scrape` url is visited and new data is obtained.

* Use Bootstrap to structure your HTML template.
